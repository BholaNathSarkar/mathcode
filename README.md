# mathcode - An open Source C/Cpp Library for Mathematics and Number Theory

## Using the header file

     At first you include  mathcode.h (#include "mathcode.h") then access all property.
    The file mathcode.h should be saved in the same directory as the program folder.

## Prime number check in O(sqrt(N)) time complexity.
 
Pass one integer in isPrime(n), it will return number prime or not.

## Primality test technique in O(Nlog(logN)) time complexity

Primality test technique which is used to generate prime numbers in a given range like from 1 to N, where N is not more than 10^7.

Call the function primality_test().
Then All the prime numbers are stored in is_prime[] array 1 to 1000000. If array value is 1 the array index is prime number.
You only at first call the function primality_test() then directly access the array is_prime[].

## Prime Factorization in O(sqrt(N)).

You pass a number through primeFact(n) and it returns a vector pair.
You need to call the function this way vector<pair<int,int>>v= primeFact(n).
Numberâ€™s all prime factor is stored in a vector pair. In first element of pair store the prime factor and in second element of pair store how many times occur the prime factor.

## Binary Exponentiation((A^N)) in O(logN) time complexity
 
Pass the base(A) and power(N) through the Function power(A,N) it will return (A^N) value in O(logN) time complexity.
 
## Prime Factorization using Sieve in O(log(N))

This is calculated by Sieve algorithm.
You call the function sieveFun() it will make an array name sieve[] and using this array value we calculate the prime factor of a number of number between 1 to 1000000.

Example: We calculate the factor of number 10.
After calling function the array sieve[] look like this,
Index=    0, 1 ,2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,10
 sieve[]={0,-1 ,2, 3, 2, 5, 2, 7, 2, 3, 2}

    n=10;
while(n)
{
    cout<<sieve[n];
     int z= sieve[n];
     n=n/z;
}

## Binomial Coefficient using Modulo inverse
At first you make an array which contain all the factorial from 1 to 10^6. (Because it takes o(n) time so time complexity will increase if we calculate it every time)
Then pass value through the function C(N,P,array). It will return the value;
